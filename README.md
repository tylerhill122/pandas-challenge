The purpose of this repository is to display our proficiency with Pandas by assembling DataFrames based on raw data of district-wide standardized test results in order to showcase trends in school performance for a local school district.

Techniques include merging csv files, GroupBy, and cutting and binning DataFrames with Pandas.

-------Observable Trends-------

The data shows that the lowest budget-per-student schools tended to outperform higher budget-per-student schools in average Math and Reading
scores, and are more likely to have students passing each subject and passing overall. The highest budget range had some
of the worst passing rates, especially in Math. The larger schools (2000 - 5000 students) had much worse overall passing
rates than small and medium-sized schools. One consideration is that the larger schools have larger budgets, but the
resources are spread too thinly amongst the students, resulting in a decrease in academic performance.
